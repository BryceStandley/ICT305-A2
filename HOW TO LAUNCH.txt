ICT305 Assignment 2 HOW TO LAUNCH instructions - PinkFluffyUnicorns


## IMPORTANT ##
Please ensure you have Python3 installed


The application leverages the 'bokeh serve' command to run and display the interactive application in a browser.

To launch the application, simply execute/open the start_app.bat file and after a few moments, your default browser will open and load the application.
You can also access it while the application server is running at the following address: http://localhost:5006

## Note
The terminal window that opens when launching the application via the start_app script or by launching the application manually from a terminal window
must remain running for the application to function. Closing the terminal window will result in the application in your browser to become unresponsive.

The start_app.bat script is simply a helper script that removes any additional commands the user has to input to launch the application. By implimenting
python venv, the application and its minimum required packages are already packages with the source files and the start_app script handels activating the venv
and launching the app with the 'bokeh serve ./ --show' command.

To launch the application directly:
    Open a terminal in the root of the project files. This folder contains the main.py file that controls creating the bokeh plots.
    Run the following command:
        '.\venv\Scripts\activate'

    Run the following command:
        'bokeh serve ./ --show'
    
    if the bokeh command is unreconised, try launching the bokeh serve command via python directly:
        'python -m bokeh serve ./ --show'

    Depending on your installation of python on Windows, you may have to use the 'py' command to launch a python script from the terminal.
